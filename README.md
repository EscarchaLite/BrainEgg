# BrainEgg
BrainEgg is a Python Brainfuck interpreter that translates Brainfuck programs into Python

I included three test programs: HelloWorld.bf, mandelbrot.b(credits to Erick Bosman) and tictactoe.b(credits to mitxela).

If you want to add any test programs or code just do a pull request. If you have any issues, please report them.
